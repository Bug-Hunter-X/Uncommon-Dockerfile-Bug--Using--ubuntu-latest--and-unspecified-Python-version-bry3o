This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Dockerfiles: using `ubuntu:latest` and failing to specify the Python version.  The `ubuntu:latest` tag is not recommended for production environments due to its instability as it can change unexpectedly. This can lead to builds breaking without warning. The solution demonstrates using a specific Ubuntu version and explicitly declaring the Python version for better reproducibility and stability.
